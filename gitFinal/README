## Reflection

Compared to my initial brainstorm,
We havent done anything since lab 14 yet 
but the plan is to use some of my lab and some
of seths lab and see what the best parts are
then we will get one by one everything done.
Piping seems to be the biggest problem
so once we figure than out it should
be smooth sailing
